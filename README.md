# Decoding Brazil’s E-Commerce Boom: A Data Story in SQL & Power BI

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes Brazilian e-commerce patterns using Olist's dataset, focusing on customer behavior and seller performance across different states. Through SQL Server data processing and Power BI visualization, we uncovered significant regional variations in pricing and market penetration. Key findings show that southern states lead in e-commerce adoption but maintain lower average prices, suggesting heightened competition. The analysis revealed that delivery timing significantly impacts customer satisfaction, with early deliveries consistently earning higher ratings. Based on these insights, we recommend optimizing delivery processes and implementing region-specific pricing strategies to enhance market performance.

## Business Problem
E-commerce companies face constant challenges in understanding regional market differences and aligning operational processes with customer expectations. This project addresses a common business problem: identifying which regions yield the highest customer value and how operational factors (like delivery times and payment processing delays) affect customer satisfaction. By analyzing sales, payment methods, and review scores across Brazilian states, the project provides insights into where businesses should focus their improvement efforts to drive both revenue and customer loyalty.

## Methodology
At a high level, the project followed these steps:
- Data Extraction: Using SQL Server to extract data from several datasets and join them into two tables representing information about customers and sellers, respectively.
- Data Cleaning & Transformation: Standardized formats, handled missing values, and transformed the data for analysis.
- Dashboard Creation: Developed two comprehensive dashboards in Power BI—one focusing on customer metrics (e.g., spending, payment methods, delivery performance) and another on seller performance (e.g., pricing, freight value, and geographic distribution).
- Visualization & Analysis: Employed various visualizations (maps, bar charts, scatter plots, and matrices) to uncover trends and correlations, such as the relationship between delivery times and review scores.

## Skills
This project showcases a range of technical and analytical skills:
- SQL Server: Utilized advanced querying techniques, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and optimized joins, to extract and prepare data.
- Data Cleaning & Transformation: Demonstrated best practices in data pre-processing and transformation to ensure accuracy.
- Power BI: Developed interactive dashboards using DAX, custom visualizations, and synchronized slicers to create an integrated analysis experience.
- Business Acumen: Combined technical analysis with business insights to make recommendations that address real-world operational challenges.
- Data Visualization: Applied effective data storytelling methods using tools like maps, bar charts, and scatter plots to translate raw data into actionable insights.

## Results & Business Recommendations
The analysis revealed several key findings:
- Regional Market Opportunities: The majority of high-value customer spending is concentrated in the southern states of Brazil. This suggests that targeted marketing and localized promotions in these regions could significantly boost revenue.
- Operational Efficiency Impacts: Orders delivered ahead of schedule are associated with higher review scores, while delays in payment processing correlate with lower satisfaction. This indicates that streamlining logistics and payment workflows could improve customer experience.
- Payment Methods: With 75% of transactions using credit cards, there’s an opportunity to further capitalize on this channel while exploring the potential of underutilized methods.

### Business Recommendations
1. Regional Strategy:
   - Implement differentiated pricing strategies for high and low-competition regions.
   - Focus expansion efforts on underserved states with higher margin potential.
2. Operational Improvements:
   - Optimize delivery processes in high-volume southern states.
   - Streamline payment approval workflows to reduce processing delays.
3. Customer Experience:
   - Implement early delivery incentives for sellers.
   - Develop automated payment processing to reduce approval times.
